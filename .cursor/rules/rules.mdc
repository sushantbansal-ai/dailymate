# React Native UI/UX and Code Standards Rule

## Core Coding Standards
- Use functional components with TypeScript and custom hooks only. Define prop interfaces with PascalCase.
- Organize by feature folders: `features/{feature}/components/`, `features/{feature}/hooks/`, `features/{feature}/styles/`.
- Always use StyleSheet.create() for styles. Favor react-native-reanimated for smooth animations over Animated API.
- Optimize lists with FlatList: keyExtractor, getItemLayout, removeClippedSubviews=true, maxToRenderPerBatch=10.
- Use Expo Router for navigation. Prefer React.memo() and useCallback/useMemo for performance.

## UI/UX Standards
- Follow Material Design 3 or iOS Human Interface Guidelines. Ensure 16dp touch targets minimum.
- Accessibility: Add accessibilityLabel, accessibilityRole, accessibilityHint to all interactive elements. Support VoiceOver/TalkBack.
- Responsive design: Use Dimensions API or react-native-responsive-screen. SafeAreaView for notches.
- Colors: Define theme with light/dark mode using useColorScheme(). Semantic names: primary, secondary, error, surface.
- Typography: Consistent scale with react-native-responsive-fontsize. Headings H1-H6, body text 16sp base.
- Spacing: 4px grid system (4,8,12,16,24,32,40). No hard-coded pixels.

## Sass/Styling Rules (if using react-native-sass-transformer)
- Nest selectors logically, use BEM methodology. Variables for theme: $primary-color, $spacing-sm.
- No CSS cursor properties – React Native doesn't support them. Use pointerEvents='none' or TouchableOpacity for interactions.
- Media queries via Dimensions.get('window').width checks.

## Mandatory Post-Generation Workflow
After writing any code:
1. **Self-Review**: Scan for violations of above standards. List issues in comments.
2. **UX Case Analysis**: 
   - Edge cases: Empty states, loading, errors, network failure.
   - User flows: Onboarding, errors, back navigation, offline mode.
   - Accessibility: Screen reader flow, high contrast, reduced motion.
   - Performance: Bundle size < 50MB, cold start < 2s, FPS > 55.
3. **Final Adjustments**: Apply fixes. Add error boundaries, skeleton loaders. Test on iOS/Android.
4. **Output Format**: Comment "✅ PASSED REVIEW" or list remaining issues. Never commit un-reviewed code.

## Enforcement
- Before finalizing code, output a checklist:
